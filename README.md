This is a simple React Project I built whilst learning how to use styled components for styling react applications and the context-API to manage state with react.
So its a simple e-commerce store built with react.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` or `yarn run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
